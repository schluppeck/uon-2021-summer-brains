# Some neuroscience notes

this repo contains some tips, tricks and a couple of projects related to finding out what neuroscience at university is like. It was prompted by discussions with a couple of budding scientists (still at high school), who wanted to find out a bit more about doing research.

## plan

- some julia notebooks and youtube clips to go along with them, explaining 
  - how to look at brain images
  - make visual stimuli
  - plot data
  - think about desinging experiments.
  - whatever comes up during discussions

## julia note book stuff

I will post some notes and details to help with julia stuff here as we go through things.

To get started with the julia notebook in this folder:

- start `julia`
- at the prompt, type ]   the open square bracket
- and activate the evironment by typing `activate .`
- make sure you have the packages installed with `instantiate` 
- the start the Pluto notebook with `Pluto.run()` and opening the `brain-notebook.jl`

I have made a little youtube clip walking through the steps...: 

1. first steps with the julia notebooks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTVC4D3SC6U
2. the next one
3. maybe a third one.

## brain / reading

- placeholder for things to be added


## other things

- it's a really good idea to have a good / powerful **text editor** (not word, because that can mess things up :). I now use Visual Studio Code (free) from Microscort -- which is very good:   https://code.visualstudio.com/
